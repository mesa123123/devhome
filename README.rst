# DevHome

Devhome is the name I have orginally given to a set of bash functions I made in order to manage my development folders and projects and how I work on them, so I've decided to build a tool that will actually handle this for me completely

Features WIP:

- Code Scaffolding - Basically builds out all the files I get pedantic about having in a personal project
  - Both generally and more specialized for specific projects, i.e. pthon with poetry vs. python with pip
- Session Management - Building a command line tool that allows me to get at my projects I have saved on my workstation
- Progress Reporting - Allows me to update progress on my work as I go about things
