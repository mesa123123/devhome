Context
----------------------------------------------------------------

I needed a mechanism in order to figure out what the hell I was doing to keep myself on track (limiting the (d) didn't feel enough for me as it allowed me to be less strict with my days, I needed a goal to reach toward with my developing so I don't just get sidetracked, focus on completing the product vs. having academic playtime).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Descision
----------------------------------------------------------------

There will be a section of the timesheet.rst file that will contain a set of requirements from the road map that I wish to complete for any one entry/session/etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Consequences
----------------------------------------------------------------

My workflow will be updated so that at the start of any development session I create a timesheet entry and fill in the planned progress section first
